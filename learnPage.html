    <h1>THE BASICS</h1>
    <h2>What is the Coronavirus? What are its symptoms, and how does it spread?</h2>
    <p>
        The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an illness with symptoms ranging from fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, to
        death due to lack of cure and proper treatment.<br>
        The Coronavirus spreads through close contact with others (about 6 ft.), indirect contact with infected
        objects/surfaces, and through the air. An individual does not have to show symptoms of the virus to be a carrier
        and/or transmitter.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>What should I do as an individual?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Don’t panic. If you think you have the Coronavirus:<br>
            Do not cause mass panic in your community. This will only aid in the spread of disease, especially if you
            live in a crowded metropolitan or urban area. Limit contact with others by staying at home and contact a
            hospital immediately for quarantine and testing.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoid close contact with people who are sick, regardless of whether they are confirmed to have the
            Coronavirus or not.
        </li>
        <li>
            Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Limit the number of large public gatherings you attend.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues. Dispose of tissues in the trash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wash your hands often (use soap and water for at least 20 seconds), especially after going to the bathroom;
            before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
        </li>
    </ul>
